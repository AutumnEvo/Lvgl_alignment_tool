# lvgl_alignment_tool
Do you hate endlessly fiddling and trying to figure out how to put things in Lvgl? Fear no more! this cursed little debug menu is here to save OUR sanity. for this cancer of a program in the form of a debug menu helps!!! Pick what you want to spawn (arc, bar, chart, etc.) and push it around instantly grab the alignment values you need for your code. No more guesswork, no more rage runing Cmake. Just spawn, align, copy, paste, done. Sanity restored ^-^
